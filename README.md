pushserver
==========
This is an open project for Pushing Service.
Mainly for mobile field, acting as GCM or APNS.

Currently, code is not so tidy and some blocks are still under developing.
But most of pushing functionalities are done.

For some legal issues, cannot put detailed technique docs here.
If you wanna, please touch the author.

Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for the concern.
